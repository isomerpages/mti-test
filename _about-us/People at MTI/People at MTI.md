## Who We Are

The Ministry of Trade and Industry's vision is to make Singapore a leading global city, supported by a dynamic economy with world-class and innovative enterprises and SMEs. As staff, we all do our best to facilitate the development of industry sectors with strong growth potential and fundamentals, enhance access to global markets for Singapore’s goods, services and investments, and provide a good understanding of the current state and outlook of the economy for policy formulation and refinement.

There are altogether nine statutory boards and one government department under the Ministry’s purview.
