#### EST Alliances for Action

To act swiftly and decisively in this global economy, we have convened the Singapore Together Alliances for Action (AfAs), which are industry-led coalitions that work in partnership with the Government to seize growth opportunities for Singapore.

Working collaboratively with both industry and government, these AfAs explored, prototyped, and executed ideas using sprints. They represent a new way forward for collaboration between the private and public sectors.

The following nine AfAs were formed under the EST:

			<strong>1. Digitalising the Built Environment</strong>
			<p>Digitalisation has been a key thrust of the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) under the Future Economy Council (FEC)’s Built Environment (BE) Cluster. Even as the industry copes with the challenges arising from COVID-19, the crisis has increased collaboration across all parts of the BE value chain. This is thus a window of opportunity to accelerate the digitalisation push to raise productivity across the BE value chain – from concept and design, to construction and site management, and facilities management.</p>

			<strong>2. EduTech</strong>
			<p>COVID-19 has accelerated the global adoption of EduTech, from home-based learning to online professional education and training. This is an opportunity for Singapore to take our education and human capital brand global.</p>

			<strong>3. Enabling Safe and Innovative Visitor Experiences</strong>
			<p>COVID-19 has fundamentally changed travel and tourism. In this new normal, Singapore must pioneer new ways to enable safe transit, safe business, and safe leisure travel and tourism. This is to ensure that Singapore remains a Global-Asia node, and a leading hub for business and enterprise in Asia Pacific, despite a potentially long COVID-19 shadow.</p>

			<strong>4. Facilitating Smart Commerce in Singapore</strong>
			<p>While COVID-19 has accelerated e-commerce adoption among consumers and retailers (especially SMEs), physical retail is likely to persist in Singapore due to the convenience of neighbourhood stores and retail hubs situated next to transport nodes (e.g. MRT stations, bus interchanges). We therefore have the conditions to create a ‘smart commerce’ ecosystem that blends digital and physical retail, and allows local stores to tap into a global consumer market. Such a system would require the complete reimagination of the online and offline shopping experience.</p>
