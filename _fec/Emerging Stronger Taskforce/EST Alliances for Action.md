#### EST Alliances for Action

To act swiftly and decisively in this global economy, we have convened the Singapore Together Alliances for Action (AfAs), which are industry-led coalitions that work in partnership with the Government to seize growth opportunities for Singapore.

Working collaboratively with both industry and government, these AfAs explored, prototyped, and executed ideas using sprints. They represent a new way forward for collaboration between the private and public sectors.

The following nine AfAs were formed under the EST:

			<strong>1. Digitalising the Built Environment</strong>
<div>Digitalisation has been a key thrust of the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) under the Future Economy Council (FEC)’s Built Environment (BE) Cluster. Even as the industry copes with the challenges arising from COVID-19, the crisis has increased collaboration across all parts of the BE value chain. This is thus a window of opportunity to accelerate the digitalisation push to raise productivity across the BE value chain – from concept and design, to construction and site management, and facilities management.</div>
