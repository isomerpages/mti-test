#### Our Achievements ####

With an aim to emerge stronger together, and to chart an agenda for action for Singapore’s economic development, the AfAs brought together EST members, business leaders, industry stakeholders, institutes of higher learning (IHLs), the Labour Movement, non-government organisations (NGOs), and government agencies, to adapt together through a new, nimble, and dynamic form of private-public partnership.

Building on our integrated ecosystem of strengths, the AfAs were established to tackle challenges in various sectors and seize growth opportunities together.

Through this dynamic partnership, the AfAs adopted an agile “startup” approach — to dream big, but start small. And we were able to achieve success in a short period of time, from developing prototypes, to rallying industry stakeholders to onboard new initiatives.

We hope that the growing momentum achieved by the AfAs will inspire you to join our journey to expand the frontiers of Singapore’s economy, for our businesses and people.
