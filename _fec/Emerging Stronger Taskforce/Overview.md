## Emerging Stronger Taskforce

To oversee the longer-term work of responding to the structural shifts in our economy, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce (EST) was set up under the Future Economy Council (FEC).  

Chaired by Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, Mr Desmond Lee, and PSA International Group CEO, Mr Tan Chong Meng, the Taskforce comprised business leaders with rich experience in key areas such as digitalisation and connectivity, and with broad perspectives on the global economy. The Taskforce also worked closely with the clusters under the FEC, as well as with partners from businesses, Trade Associations and Chambers, unions, and Institutes of Higher Learning.

The EST was part of Singapore Together, which was launched in 2019 with the vision for Singaporeans to partner with the Government, and with one another, to own, shape and act on our shared future together. Singapore Together also aims to open up more partnership opportunities for Singaporeans, and support more citizen-led initiatives.
