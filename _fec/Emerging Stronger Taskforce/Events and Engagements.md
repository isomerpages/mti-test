### AfA on Digitalising Built Environment Visit to Kranji Green, 9 April 

The Alliance for Action (AfA) on Digitalising Built Environment visited Kranji Green, a development project of JTC Corporation, to see first-hand the good progress made by the AfA in accelerating digital transformation of the Built Environment Cluster. The visit also demonstrated how digital platforms are applied to help industry partners achieve end-to-end digitalisation in the Built Environment Cluster.
