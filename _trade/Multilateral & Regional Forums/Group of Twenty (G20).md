## Group of Twenty (G20)

The Group of Twenty (G20) comprises 19 major economies and the European Union. The first G20 Summit was convened by the US in 2008 in response to the emerging financial crisis. Since then, G20 Summits have been held annually.  
  
Singapore is not a G20 Member. However, we have been invited to participate in the G20 Summit and its related processes from 2010 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2020. Singapore participates as a representative of the Global Governance Group (3G), which is an informal grouping of 30 small and medium-sized members of the United Nations. Among other objectives, the 3G was established to promote greater transparency and inclusivity in the G20 processes by encouraging stronger linkages between the G20 and the broader UN Membership.  
  
  
#### Recent Highlights 
  
On 1 December 2019, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia assumed the G20 Presidency under the theme of “Realising Opportunities of the 21st Century for All.” This theme covers three main thrusts, namely (a) creating conditions for all to live, work and thrive, (b) fostering collective efforts to safeguard the planet, and (c) shaping new frontiers to share the benefits of innovation. As an invited guest country to the G20 meetings in 2020, Singapore supports and actively contributes to G20 discussions.  

Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing participated in two virtual G20 Trade Ministers Meeting in March and May 2020. At these meetings, Trade Ministers from G20 and guest countries agreed on the importance of coordinated trade and investment measures to counter the negative impact of COVID-19 on global demand and supply. The Ministers also affirmed their commitment to restore confidence and continuity of trade, by facilitating the flow of goods and services as well as reducing the risk and disruption to global health supply chains. To these ends, a series of collective actions were endorsed that aimed to alleviate the wide-ranging impact of COVID-19, support the multilateral trading system, and expedite longer-term recovery.
