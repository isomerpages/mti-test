## Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)

The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is a gathering of heads-of-government from member countries in Asia and Europe to forge a strong partnership between the two continents. The objective of ASEM is to strengthen economic, political and cultural ties between Asia and Europe. The partnership would be based on:

* Common commitment to market economy
* An open multilateral trading system consistent with the World Trade Organisation (WTO)
* Open regionalisation
* Non-discriminatory liberalisation.
