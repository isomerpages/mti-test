At MTI, we are committed to developing our officers.  
  
Our career development framework offers a wide range of foundational and customised courses and programmes such as our MTI Induction programme for new hires, Basic Trade course and Industry foundation course. Not forgetting sponsorships for further studies.  
   
Opportunities such as rotations within and secondment out of MTI are also available. Officers may also be offered postings or attachments to MTI’s overseas offices in the US, China, Europe and India.  
   
We work and play hard at MTI. We offer flexible work schedules to promote work-life harmony. Organisation-wide events and self-organised interest groups (e.g. running groups) help you strike a balance between work and play.
