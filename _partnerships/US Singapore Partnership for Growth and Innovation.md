**About US-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI)**

Building on our strong ties, the United States and Singapore have launched a strategic pathfinder for new ways to deepen economic integration between the United States and Southeast Asia.

The Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI) was signed by US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong on 7 October 2021.

The PGI aims to increase collaboration between US and Singapore companies by strengthening trade and investment collaboration in new and forward-looking areas, starting with (i) digital economy and smart cities; (ii) advanced manufacturing and supply chains; (iii) clean energy and environmental technologies; and (iv) healthcare.

Wherever possible, businesses and governments from the broader Southeast Asia region are welcomed to participate in PGI activities.
